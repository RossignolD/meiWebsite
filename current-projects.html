                        A spin-off of the classic board game Monopoly themed around the Masters of Logic (MoL) at the University of Amsterdam and 
                        the Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation (ILLC) that is there. Instead of moving around the board and purchasing 
                        real estate in Atlantic City, in MoL-opoly the goal is to collaborate with as many logicians as possible and rake in
                        the juicy social credit that having your published theorems cited brings. All of the logicians on the board are real,
                        and work (or had worked) at the ILLC at the time of creation.

                    This project began with the attempt to prove R. Montague's <em>Paradox of Grounded Classes</em> in the natural deduction
                    style of Kalish, Montague, and Mar. What Montague proved in a single paragraph and my friend in 36 lines, I proved
                    with my own constraints (but in the style of KMM) in 50 lines with a similar notation to my friend. The project then 
                    shifted in an artistic direction as I decided that I wanted to display the proof in a nice way. I decided to blend 
                    the "cold and austere" (B. Russell, <em>A History of Western Philosophy</em>) beauty of pure logic with the colorful
                    and tactile beauty of embroidery. Every time a sub-derivation is begun, the color changes.

                    This website should count for a current project. It has taught me much about the limitations of the <em>flexbox</em>, as well as how
                    many centering commands there are in CSS, among other things. 
                    I also had a bit of fun with the JS, learning new jQuery commands to make the interactive CV and the magic
                    button on the homepage work. Visit again and there might be a blog!
