                            This project, DragLogic was developed under the supervision of Paul St. Denis at the
                            Teaching and Learning Lab job.
                            The original goal of the project was to create a drag-and-drop natural deduction program, to
                            be used by the Introduction to Symbolic
                            Logic class at Stony Brook University. The plan was to mirror the style of natural deduction
                            presented in Kalish, Montague, and Mar's
                            textbook, <em>Logic: Techniques of Formal Reasoning.</em> It evolved into a more axiomatic
                            derivation system as the difficulty
                            of writing a logic engine in Javascript began to mount with every inference rule. The system
                            was finally reduced to
                            a axiomatic derivation system in the style of ≈Åukasiewicz, and saw its sunset in early 2022.

                        This project was started around the same time as DragLogic's development began. The goal of the project was to create
                        an agent-based model of hermit-crab shell-swapping behaviors, a research interest of two biologists in the 
                        Evolution and Ecology Department at Stony Brook University. These two scientists discovered in their research that 
                        hermit-crab shell size distribution follows patterns similar to those found in human income distributions. This 
                        model, built in the software tool NetLogo, allows students to change parameters and experiment with the model
                        to discover the phenomenon for themselves.
